Problem Statement:
Up sell and Cross Sell of products

Initial State:
The sales are done on a ad-hoc basis. There is no strategies for upselling and cross selling of products to the customers.

Final State:
This is being used to upsell and cross sell products by the sales team.

Questions:
1) What are the data points to be needed? Are there any redundancies and inconsistencies present among various databases? What new information has to be captured going forward?
2) What and how to present the organization data in Tableau to bolster the users to make effective decisions?

Approach:

Data preparation: 
1) Data points were aggregated at the level of ,
Revenue, Type of Revenue, Business Units, Country, Industry, DateTime, Customer, Product, Product Category

Redundant data like other sub branches of product category were removed and the sales team comments, product managers name 

The following Inconsistencies were resolved among data from different data sources,
1) The date time format was different
2) The format of the locations’ names was different

Data Issues:
All the clients did not have a mapping to an ultimate parent from Dun and Brad street data. They have to be manually searched for their parents one at a time which was enormously time consuming.

A third party service provider created the final data warehouse which I leveraged for analysis

Dashboard creation:
1) Tableau was connected to Oracle sql server database
2) The pen and paper version of the dashboard was taken a sign off from the client
3) Dashboard with each customer’s sales information along with the information of their peers was shown using graphs. Had information about products purchased along with its timestamp 
4) The dashboard was created only for a subset of important customers’ data. Leveraged bar charts, line graphs, reference lines, tree map, world maps, pie chart, area chart, highlight tables

Insights example:
For upselling, take 3 banking customers. TCF bank, JP Morgan, US bank. US bank is using a product in finance from 3 years and has a high usage. On the other hand, JP Morgan who is also into the same finance industry is not using it. This will be visible from the dashboard and the Sales team can research about its product specifications from the products team and pitch this product to JP Morgan.
Similarly, for cross selling. If US bank is having a high usage on a legal product from a long time and TCF bank does not have any usage. The sales team can research about its product specifications from the products team and pitch this to TCF bank. 

In this process, the organization earns a good relation since it is trying to improve the customer in some way.
  
Next Steps:
1) Finish the manual mapping of all the customers to their parent organization names
2) Run the dashboard on the entire customers’ data
3) Follow up with the sales team for modifications as per their views
